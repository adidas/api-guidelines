# Corporate Data Model
The design of application data model **MUST** consider the application use cases as well as the upstream and downstream systems use cases.

The design of the data model of an application **MUST** consider the [adidas Corporate Data Model](https://collaboration.adidas-group.com/sites/CS-GDM/Corporate Data Dictionary/Data Dictionary.htm) (internal link).

Different names for entities and attributes **MAY** be used **ONLY** if the **CDM** is not including them. If a different name is introduced then it **MUST** be included in the **CDM**.

Consistency of the names of entities and attributes across the whole application **MUST** be maintained.
