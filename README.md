## adidas API Guidelines

_Guidelines for API design and development at adidas_ \([Read online at GitBook](https://adidas.gitbook.io/api-guidelines/)\)

### Motivation

The goal of this document is to facilitate the work and minimize the effort of all API users while protecting their investment and encouraging API adoption.

The guidelines lay down the foundation for collaboration, stability, and extensibility.

### Guidelines

The API Guidelines are split into two main parts:

* [General Guidelines](general-guidelines/general-guidelines.md)
* API type-specific Guidelines
  * [REST APIs Guidelines](rest-api-guidelines/rest.md)
  * [Kafka Guidelines](kafka-guidelines/kafka.md)

The general guidelines section discusses the core principles relevant to any kind of API. The API type-specific section further defines the guidelines specific to a given architectural style or API technique \(such as REST, Kafka or GraphQL API\).

### How to read the Guidelines

These Guidelines are available for online reading at [GitBook](https://adidas.gitbook.io/api-guidelines/) its source can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/adidas/api-guidelines).
