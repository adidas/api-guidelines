### Motivation

The goal of this document is to facilitate the work and minimize the effort of all API users at adidas while protecting their investment and encouraging API First adoption.

These guidelines lay down the foundation for collaboration, stability, and extensibility.

### Guidelines

The API Guidelines are split into two main parts:

* [General Guidelines](https://adidas.gitbook.io/api-guidelines/general-guidelines/general-guidelines)
* API type-specific Guidelines
  * [REST APIs Guidelines](https://adidas.gitbook.io/api-guidelines/rest-api-guidelines/rest)
  * [Asynchronous APIs Guidelines](https://adidas.gitbook.io/api-guidelines/asynchronous-api-guidelines/a_introduction)

The general guidelines section discusses the core principles relevant to any kind of API.&#x20;

The API type-specific section further defines the guidelines specific to a given architectural style or API technique (such as REST, Kafka or GraphQL APIs).

### How to read the Guidelines

These guidelines are available for online reading at [GitBook](https://adidas.gitbook.io/api-guidelines/). The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/adidas/api-guidelines).

The CAPITALIZED words throughout these guidelines have a special meaning:

> ```
> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
> "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
> this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.
> ```

Refer to [RFC2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) for details.

### Validating your API specification against OpenAPI & Async rules

In the `ruleset.md` file you can find a digest of API Guidelines rules which you can use to validate your API description documents.

If you are using OpenAPI or AsyncAPI specification as API description format, you can also leverage the `adidas-spectral.yaml` ruleset to automatically lint your specification compliance using [Spectral](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/674b27b261c3c-overview).

> To install Spectral, you will need Node.js and a package manager (npm or yarn).

```bash
npm install -g @stoplight/spectral-cli

# OR

yarn global add @stoplight/spectral-cli
```

Once installed, to verify your _oas_ or _async_ file with spectral execute:

```bash
spectral lint <api-specification-file> --ruleset adidas-spectral.yaml
```
