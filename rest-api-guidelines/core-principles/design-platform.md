# API Design Platform

1. [SwaggerHub](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/) is the primary platform supporting [API first approach](../../general-guidelines/api-first.md). SwaggerHub **SHOULD** be used during API Design.
2. Every API description **MUST** be stored in [SwaggerHub](https://http://design.api.3stripes.io/) under the adidas team.
3. SwaggerHub **MUST** be the **single source of truth** to learn about existing APIs within the organization.

> NOTE: SwaggerHub supports API-first approach in multiple ways:  
> For example, it validates API description for correctness and automatically generates API documentation to drive the discussion between stakeholders. \(No more emails with API description flying between stakeholders\)
>
> NOTE: The synchronization between the version control system and adidas API Design platform 
> should be automated (e.g. using CI/CD framework or the Design Platform capabilities).
