# HAL

The Hypertext Application Language [`application/hal+json`](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) \(HAL\) **MUST** be used as the representation format of a resource.

## Introduction to HAL

> _HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API._

The HAL format is strictly coupled to [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS). The main target of HATEOAS is to decouple the API Consumer from the paths used in the API. The API Client uses the links generated by our API instead of building them from the documentation. This is less eror-prone for the API Consumer and it can allow making changes in the API without affecting the API Consumer code.

This document is an informal introduction to the HAL media type. For more details see [HAL - Hypertext Application Language Specification](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html).

## HAL Document Object Model

HAL document follow the object model defined in JSON-schema [here](https://supermodel.io/adidas/api/HAL). 

IANA created a list explaining the standard relationships for REST. Do not forget to have a look [here](http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml) to find the role of each type of relation. 

YAML code snippets are provided for [OpenAPI Specification 2.0/Swagger](https://github.com/adidas/api-guidelines/tree/4a033eb0cf8ec582102c09c1eb5ba1fa8a5597d9/rest-api-guidelines/functionality/message/HAL-snippet.yaml) and [OpenAPI Specification 3.x](https://github.com/adidas/api-guidelines/tree/4a033eb0cf8ec582102c09c1eb5ba1fa8a5597d9/rest-api-guidelines/functionality/message/HAL-snippet-full-OpenApi3.yaml).

## Simple Document Example

The simplest Hal document looks like an empty JSON \(it is an empty JSON!\):

```javascript
{
}
```

A document representing a "Greeting" resource might look like:

```javascript
{
  "message": "Hello World!",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/greeting"
    }
  }
}
```

The field `_links` has a special meaning in HAL. It denotes a list of link relations - a pair of a relation identifier and a link \(URI\).

These link relations are used to express the relation of a resource with other resources.

In our case the "Greeting" resource isn't related to other resources but itself, hence the `self` relation pointing to the Greeting resource.

> NOTE: It is **customary** for every resource representation to include the `self` link relation.
>
> NOTE: The href **MUST** always be **relative path to the API root** \(e.g. without the host and scheme\).

## Relation Example

A more complex document example could be an "Order" resource that has a related resource "Author" \(a person who created the order. It might look like:

```javascript
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/orders/1234"
    },
    "author": {
      "href": "/users/john"
    }
  },
  "orderNumber": 1234,
  "itemCount": 42,
  "status": "pending"
}
```

## Embedding Example

Let's assume there is an "Orders" resource which is a collection of all orders from different authors. There is the relation between the Orders resource and possibly many Order resources.

We could express this in the `_links` object using the `order` relation, but sometimes it is practical to "embed" \(entirely or partially\) related resources representations in the originating resource representation. For a scenario like this HAL offers the `_embedded` field.

The `_embedded` field's object just contains the related resources HAL representations:

```javascript
{
  "_links": {
    "self": { "href": "/orders" }
  },
  "_embedded": {
    "order": [
      {
        "_links": {
          "self": { "href": "/orders/1" }
        },
        "orderNumber": "1",
        "status": "pending"
      },
      {
        "_links": {
          "self": { "href": "/orders/2" }
        },
        "orderNumber": "2",
        "status": "cancelled"
      }      
    ]
  }
}
```

It is important to understand that embedded resource representation might be only **partial** and might also contain their own embedded resources.

The embedded resource representation should be used as a **convenience** function \(e.g. to reduce the initial number of calls needed at application launch\).

Where a full and up-to-date representation of a resource is needed the link relation should exercise the affordance \(e.g. `GET /orders/2`\).

#### Real-world Examples

Some APIs using HAL:

* [Amazon AppStream REST API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream/latest/developerguide/appstream-api-rest.html)
* [FoxyCart](https://wiki.foxycart.com/v/2.0/start)
* [Clarify.io](http://docs.clarify.io/overview/)
* [University of Oxford / Mobile Oxford](http://api.m.ox.ac.uk/browser/#/)

## Working with HAL

Refer to the [extensive list of libraries that work with HAL](https://github.com/mikekelly/hal_specification/wiki/Libraries).

### Java

#### Spring Framework

Spring framework supports HAL out of the box. More info can be found in [Spring Documentation](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-hateoas/) and [examples](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-rest-hateoas).

#### Quarkus Framework

Quarkus framework supports HAL out of the box. More info can be found in [Quarkus Documentation](https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-data-panache).

### NodeJS

For working with HAL and Node.js using [HALson npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/halson) is suggested.
