# API Design Platform - Apiary

1. [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) is the primary platform supporting [API first approach](./api-first.md). Apiary **MUST** be used during API Design.

1. Every API description **MUST** be stored in [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) under the ADIDAS GROUP team.

1. Apiary **MUST** be the **single source of truth** to learn about existing APIs within the organization.
 
> NOTE: Apiary supports API-first approach in multiple ways:
  a. Validates API description for correctness and automatically generates API documentation to drive the discussion between stakeholders. (No more emails with API description flying between stakeholders)
