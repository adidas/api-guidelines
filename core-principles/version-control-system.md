# Version Control System
Every API description **SHOULD** be stored in a Version Control System (Bitbucket, GitHub). Where possible the API description **SHOULD** stored in the **same** repository as the API implementation.

> NOTE: The synchronization between the version control system and adidas [API Description platform](./apiary.md) 
 should be automated using CI/CD framework.
